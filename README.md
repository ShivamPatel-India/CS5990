# Lane Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions

Lane Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions is a Python-based project focused on enhancing lane detection accuracy in challenging weather conditions like rain and clouds. Leveraging the CARLA Simulator and various sensors, including LiDAR, RGB, and depth cameras, the project utilizes the Hough Transform algorithm for robust lane detection.

## Project Overview

### Features

- **Adverse Weather Lane Detection:**
  - Enhances lane detection accuracy under challenging weather conditions, such as rain and clouds.

- **CARLA Simulator Integration:**
  - Utilizes the CARLA Simulator for realistic testing and simulation of adverse weather scenarios.

- **Sensor Fusion:**
  - Integrates data from different sensors, including LiDAR, RGB, and depth cameras, to improve lane detection precision.

- **Hough Transform Algorithm:**
  - Implements the Hough Transform algorithm for lane detection, providing a reliable method for identifying lane boundaries.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:**
  - Python

- **Tools:**
  - CARLA Simulator (version 0.9.5)
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy

## Getting Started

To run the Lane Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions project, follow these steps:

0. Check your machines specifications whether they met the requirements of CARLA simulator or not. Because CARLA requires high GPU specs.
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies 
3. Run the project
